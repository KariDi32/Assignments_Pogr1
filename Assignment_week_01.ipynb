    "As a Data Scientist you often have lots of data at our disposal. Unfortunately, data from real-life cases is often not nicely structured. We need to manipulate the unstructured and/or messy data into a structured or clean form. We need to drop rows and columns because they are not needed for the analysis or because we cannot use them in case of too many missing values. Maybe we need to relabel columns or reformat characters into numerical values. Or we need to combine data from several sources. Cleaning and manipulating data into a structured form is called data preparation. In this week we will practice the cleaning and manipulation of EEG data in order to conduct graphical and statistical analysis. We will use tools often used by data scientists; `python`, `numpy`, `pandas` and `bokeh`. You will learn about data wrangling with `pandas` and `numpy` and you will learn to visualize with `bokeh`. Concretely, you will preprocess the brain EEG data in an appropiate format in order to conduct statistical and visual analysis. \n",

The original dataset from the reference consists of 5 different folders, each with 100 files, with each file representing a single subject/person.
